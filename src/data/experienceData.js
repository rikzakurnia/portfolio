      description: 'Participated in the prestigious Bangkit Academy, a comprehensive learning program led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, and Traveloka. During this program, I specialized in the Cloud Computing learning path where I gained in-depth knowledge of cloud computing principles and practices. I learned about various Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services including Cloud Run, Cloud Storage, and many other GCP services. The program included practical demonstrations and hands-on projects, which enhanced my understanding of deploying and managing applications on the cloud. Additionally, I learned about creating and hosting APIs using backend servers, and deploying applications that incorporate machine learning models. For the final project, my team developed a spice recognition application called Rempahpedia. I was responsible for the deployment and API management, ensuring the application was effectively hosted and operated smoothly on the cloud.',
